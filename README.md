## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? --> So far, no steps required as it is just a readme file :)

## Architecture
